Welcome to my very first terminal application!

Recipe pro is a terminal app which was created as a part of Coder Academy Web Development Bootcamp - Term 1 assignment. 

I really enjoy cooking, and have collected all my favourite recipes over the years and have them stored either as a paper copy in a folder or a picture on my onedrive. 

The weekly time consuming tradition of searching through my recipes and writing out a grocery list, is what gave birth to the idea for Recipe Pro! The app stores all of my favourite recipes and allows the user to search by ingredient.

The app currently has three main features:
- Search recipes based on ingredients
- View recipes
- Select ingredients to added to a grocery list

I hope you enjoy using it! I'll be aiming to add more features to it as my Ruby coding skills improve.

Happy cheffing!
